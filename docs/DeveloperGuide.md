### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`, `PinList` and `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` object residing in the `Model`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TrackAScholarParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TrackAScholarParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TrackAScholarParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores TrackAScholar data i.e., all `Applicant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TrackAScholarBook`, which `Applicant` references. This allows `TrackAScholar` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Applicant` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TrackAScholar data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TrackAScholarStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.trackascholar.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add applicant feature

#### Implementation

The add operation is facilitated by `AddCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `add n/Sam p/98886767 e/sam@example.com s/NUS Merit Scholarship as/pending`, for example, to add a new applicant.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `add` and
   the arguments `n/Sam p/98886767 e/sam@example.com s/NUS Merit Scholarship as/pending`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `add` command and `AddCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `AddCommandParser#parse()`
   to map the various arguments via their prefixes (e.g. `Sam` is mapped using prefix `n/`).

3. `AddCommandParser#parse()` will then call `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` to ensure that all mandatory prefixes are present
   in the user input, after which the various arguments will be retrieved via the prefixes and parsed into their respective attributes.

4. `AddCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `Applicant` with the various attributes before finally initializing and returning an `AddCommand`
   with the new `Applicant` as an argument.

5. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `AddCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#hasApplicant()` to check if the new `Applicant` is a
   duplicate of any applicant already stored in TrackAScholar. When the check has concluded and no duplicate was found, `Model#addApplicant()`
   is called to add the new `Applicant` into TrackAScholar.

6. `AddCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details about the applicant's successful addition to TrackAScholar.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add` Command example](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Filter application status feature

#### Implementation

The filter operation is facilitated by `FilterCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `filter pending`, for example, to filter out applicants with pending scholarship application status.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `filter` and
   the argument `pending`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `filter` command and `FilterCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `FilterCommandParser#parse()`
   which checks that the argument is a valid application status by calling `ApplicationStatus#isValidApplicationStatus()`.

3. After passing the check, `FilterCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `ApplicationStatusPredicate` with the argument before finally initializing and returning a `FilterCommand`
   with the new `ApplicationStatusPredicate` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `FilterCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` to filter out the list of
   applicants with the matching application status. When the operation has concluded, `Model#getFilteredApplicantList()`
   is called to retrieve the filtered list, such that TrackAScholar can count the total number of applicants in that particular list.

5. `FilterCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details of how many applicants were found with a matching scholarship application status.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `filter` Command example](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a filter command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sort applicants by name, scholarship or status feature.

#### Implementation

The sort operation is facilitated by `SortCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `sort name`, for example, to sort all applicants by name in ascending lexicographic order.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `sort` and
   the argument `name`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `sort` command and `SortCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `SortCommandParser#parse()`
   which checks if the arguments have the valid parameter name and flag by calling `List#contains()` and `SortCommandParser#checkInputSizeAndReverseFlag()` respectively.

3. After passing the check, `SortCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `Comparator<Applicant>` with the argument before finally initializing and returning a `SortCommand`
   with the new `Comparator<Applicant>` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `SortCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` to filter out the list of
   applicants with the matching application status. When the operation has concluded, `Model#getFilteredApplicantList()`
   is called to retrieve the filtered list, such that TrackAScholar can count the total number of applicants in that particular list.

5. `SortCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing the newly sorted applicant list according to the input parameters.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort` Command example](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Remove applicants by application status feature

#### Implementation

The remove operation is facilitated by `RemoveCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the remove operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `remove accepted`, for example, to remove all applicants with accepted scholarship application status.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `remove` and
   the argument `accepted`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `remove` command and `RemoveCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `RemoveCommandParser#parse()`.

3. `RemoveCommandParser#parse()` now parses the argument and creates a new `ApplicationStatus` before finally initializing and returning a `RemoveCommand`
   with the new `ApplicationStatus` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `RemoveCommand#execute()`, which invokes `RemoveCommand#promptUserConfirmation()`. TrackAScholar now displays
   a window asking for the user's confirmation to remove the applicants. After the user confirms, `RemoveCommand#confirmRemove()` is called which
   in turn calls `Model#removeApplicant()` to remove all applicants from the list matching the targeted `ApplicationStatus`.

5. `RemoveCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of the successful removal.

The following sequence diagram shows how the remove operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `remove` Command example](images/RemoveSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The GUI interactions when `RemoveCommand#execute()` calls `RemoveCommand#promptUserConfirmation()`
is abstracted out as this sequence diagram aims only to demonstrate the interactions inside Logic Component for the `remove` command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Find feature

#### Implementation

We will use find name as an example.

The find operation is facilitated by `FindCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find command operates in TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `find n/john` into the terminal.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `find` and
   the arguments `n/ john`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `find` command and `FindCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `FindCommandParser#parse()`
    It checks for a valid prefix which can be of type name, scholarship or major.It throws out an error if a valid prefix is not found.

3. Since a valid prefix for name is present `FindCommandParser#parse()` will then call `parsePredicates` with the argument `john`.

4. In `parsePredicates` an empty is first created `applicantPredicateList` before, it checks for the type of prefix accompanying the argument which be of type  name, scholarship or major.

5. After identifying the prefix is of type name it will call `getKeywordsList` to get the keyword for searching and in this case it will be `john`.

6. After identifying the keyword `john` the method, `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be invoked with the argument `john`.

7. `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` will check if any names in the main list has `john` present in their names.If `john` is present, that name in the main
    list will be added to `applicantPredicateList`.All valid names are added to `applicantPredicateList`

8. `FilterCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a FindCommand containing all the individuals with names matching the keyword `john`. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the pin operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find` Command example](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a pin command:

![Find command activity diagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Edit applicant feature

#### Implementation

The edit operation is facilitated by `EditCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `edit 1 n/Sam p/91234567 e/samnew@example.com s/NUS Sports Scholarship as/accepted`, for example, to edit an existing applicant at index 1 in the list.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `edit` and
   the arguments `1 n/Sam p/91234567 e/samnew@example.com s/NUS Sports Scholarship as/accepted`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `edit` command and `EditCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `EditCommandParser#parse()`
   to map the various arguments via their prefixes (e.g. `Sam` is mapped using prefix `n/`).

3. `EditCommandParser#parse()` will then call `Optional#isPresent()` to check if a prefix is present
   in the user input, to identify which inputs need to be changed.

4. `EditCommandParser#parse()` creates an `EditApplicantDescriptor` object with the various attributes to be changed before 
   initializing and returning an `EditCommand` with the `EditApplicantDescriptor` as an argument.

5. `EditCommandParser#parse()` throws a `ParseException` if index is not a positive integer and a `CommandException` if index 
   is larger than the list size.

6. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `EditCommand#execute()`, which creates a new `Applicant` object with the updated applicant fields.
    `Model#setApplicant` is used to update the current applicant with the new applicant. 

7. `EditCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details about the applicant's successful edit and the applicant's details in TrackAScholar.


The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the pin operation is handled by TrackAScholar:
1. The user enters `pin 1`, for example, to pin an existing applicant at index 1 in the list.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `pin` and
   the argument `1`.
2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `pin` command and `PinCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `PinCommandParser#parse()`.
3. `PinCommandParser#parse()` now parses the argument and creates a new `Index` before initializing a `PinCommand`
    with the new `Index` as an argument.
4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `PinCommand#execute()`, which creates a new `Applicant` object with the updated `Pin` field.
   `Model#setApplicant()` is later invoked, which updates the existing applicant with the new applicant.
5. `PinCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of the successful pinning of an applicant.

The unpin operation is facilitated by `UnPinCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the unpin operation is handled by TrackAScholar:
1. The user enters `unpin Alex Yeoh`, for example, to unpin a pinned applicant with full name matching `Alex Yeoh`.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `unpin` and
   the argument `Alex Yeoh`.
2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `unpin` command and `UnPinCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `UnPinCommandParser#parse()`.
3. `UnPinCommandParser#parse()` now parses the argument and creates a new `Name` before initializing a `UnPinCommand`
   with the new `Name` as an argument.
4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `UnPinCommand#execute()`, which creates a new `Applicant` object with the updated `Pin` field.
   `Model#setApplicant()` is later invoked, which updates the existing applicant with the new applicant.
5. `UnPinCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of the successful unpinning of an applicant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Proposed features**

Coming soon in future iterations.

For future iterations we plan to implement 2 new features.

1. Sending of application results directly to email of the applicants.
This will help applicant be notified of their result more quickly.
It will also cut down the workload for admin staff.
In this current iteration we still have to message the client manually.

2. Exporting of Json file into Excel.
The university admin staff might want to process or analyse the result in a more sophisticated manner.
Excel is needed to aid in more sophisticated analysis as it has more functions.

## **Appendix: Effort**
Given that the effort for creating AddressBook3(AB3) is rated as a 10, our team believes that the effort required to 
build TrackAScholar is estimated around 12.

Over the span of 1 month, my group has spent tremendous amount of time and energy in refactoring and transforming
AB3's model, such that it fulfils the criterion and standards needed by TrackAScholar.

Moreover, this is supported by the fact that our code contributions are approximated around 9k lines of code(LoC), emphasizing 
our commitment to improving the features and testability of TrackAScholar and improving the overall experience for our users.


### Outstanding features
* Add
* Edit
* Remove
* Clear
* Find
* Filter
* Sort
* Import
* Pin / Unpin


### Notable design principles used
* Utilised Test Driven Development
  * Every time our team puts in either a new feature or a new field to TrackAScholar, 
  we strive to write JUnit test cases alongside the new functional code added,
  thus minimising the chances of obtaining bugs at a later stage, where it might be too
  late or difficult to fix such bugs.
  * Moreover, we also took turns testing each other's features at various milestones, 
  thus allowing us to identify and amend bugs much earlier.
  * After PED, my team start rectifying and filtering the respective bugs immediately,
  thus mitigating the number of bugs in TrackAScholar.

* Maintaining high code quality and standards
  * By following the large amount of abstraction possessed by AB3, we aim to minimise duplicability of code in TrackAScholar 
  and thus reducing the amount of code written. This is evident from `Command` and `Ui` interfaces etc.
  * Moreover, we adhered to the KISS principle and tried to keep our methods short and simple, thus
  maintaining readability of our code. This is evident from the lack of long methods and nesting within TrackAScholar 
  code base.
