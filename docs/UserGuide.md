## Introduction

#### What is TrackAScholar?

TrackAScholar (TAS) is the **only** desktop app any university administrative staff needs for managing scholarship applications.
TAS helps administrative staff manage scholarship applications by storing the applicant's contact details, scholarship applied and majors taken all in one place.

TAS  presenting the administrative staff with the option to pin important applicants, edit their details easily,
 find or filter for applicants with ease and otherwise speeds up the application process.

TAS is **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while simultaneously having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface
(GUI)**. If you can type fast, TAS can handle your scholarship application process faster than conventional GUI apps.

#### Who is this User Guide for?

We have created this user manual for people who want to learn how to use our app.
It is best suited for administrative staff members who seek an app to streamline their scholarship management procedure.

Alternatively, you may read our [Developer Guide](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w10-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)

## Overview of TrackAScholar app

![Overview of TrackAScholar app](images/UserGuideCommands/TrackAScholarOverview.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Command words and prefixes have to be in `lower_case` **(Case sensitive)**.<br>
  Command words includes `help`, `list`, `exit` etc.<br>
  Prefixes are used to recognise the different parameters input by the user, these include `n/`, `p/`, `e/` etc.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [m/MAJOR]` can be used as `n/John Doe m/Business` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in angle brackets are fixed, precise values.<br>
  e.g. `<ACCEPTED>` means the parameter must be an input of the value `ACCEPTED`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MAJOR]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/Business`, `m/Medicine m/Dentistry` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
