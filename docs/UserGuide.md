TrackAScholar (TAS) is **a desktop application for managing scholarship applications,
optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
TAS can get your scholarship applicant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Install Java `11` or above. Check [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html#programming-language).

1. Download the latest `TrackAScholar.jar`. Check [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/releases).

1. Move the jar file to an empty folder

1.  Double-click the jar file to open the app. If the app does not respond, open your terminal in the current folder and enter `java -jar TrackAScholar.jar` to open the app.

1. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
